# Visualizing the decision process of GNN computer-aided Alzheimer's Disease diagnosis

The aim of this work is to remove the information barrier created by cutting edge systems computer-aided diagnostic (CAD)
systems within a clinical environment — providing the results of models in a clear and interpretable format for clinicians
and their patients.

The focus of this study first uses a Graph-Neural Network to predict current condition of a patient's Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.
Thereafter, the results are interpreted and formatted using a variety of visualization techniques, such as:
- Graphs
- Histograms
- Plots
